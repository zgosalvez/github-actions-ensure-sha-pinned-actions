# GitHub Action â€” Ensure SHA Pinned Actions
[![CI](https://github.com/zgosalvez/github-actions-ensure-sha-pinned-actions/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zgosalvez/github-actions-ensure-sha-pinned-actions/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This GitHub Action (written in JavaScript) allows you to leverage GitHub Actions to ensure that GitHub Actions are pinned to full length commit SHAs. This does not fail for referenced actions in the same repository when using the [`./path/to/dir` syntax](https://docs.github.com/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#referencing-an-action-in-the-same-repository-where-a-workflow-file-uses-the-action). For more information, see "[using third-party actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)."

## Usage
### Pre-requisites
Create a workflow `.yml` file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#common-workflow) is available below. For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs
For more information on these inputs, see the [Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepswith)

- `allowlist`: The list of owners or repositories that will be ignored and will not throw an error. Each entry must be on a new line. Optional. Default: `` (deny all). For example,
```yaml
  allowlist: |
    aws-actions/          # Trust all actions published by aws-actions
    docker/login-action   # Trust docker's login-action only
```
- `dry_run`: Set to `true` to show warnings instead of failing. Optional. Default: `false` (fail on any error)

### Outputs
None. This action will throw an error if it finds GitHub Actions that are not pinned to full length commit SHAs.

### Common workflow

Ideally, set this up as an initial job for your workflows. For example:
```yaml
on: push

name: Continuous Integration

jobs:
  harden_security:
    name: Harden Security
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@5a4ac9002d0be2fb38bd78e4b4dbde5606d7042f # v2.3.4
      - name: Ensure SHA pinned actions
        uses: zgosalvez/github-actions-ensure-sha-pinned-actions@v1.0.1 # Replace this
        with:
          allowlist: |
            aws-actions/
            docker/login-action
```
